# C++ Calculators
This project contains a series of C++ calculator programs, ranging from basic to complex. Each calculator demonstrates various C++ principles, data structures, and algorithms. The goal is to provide examples that cater to different levels of understanding and complexity in C++ programming.
Basic Calculator

The first file, labeled basicCalculator.cpp, is a C++ program that employs several fundamental principles of C++. This basic calculator is designed to perform simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Below is an overview of the key features and concepts demonstrated in this program:

    Basic Input and Output:
        The program utilizes cin and cout for user input and output, respectively.
        It prompts the user to enter two numbers and the desired operation.

    Control Structures:
        It uses if, else if, and else statements to determine the operation to perform based on user input.
        Basic error checking for invalid operations is included.

    Arithmetic Operations:
        The core functionality includes addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
        Each operation is implemented using standard arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /).

    Basic Functions:
        The program may include basic functions to encapsulate the arithmetic operations, demonstrating the use of function definitions and calls.

The second program, divided into basicCalculator2.cpp and basicCalculator2.h, builds upon the basic principles and introduces more advanced concepts such as modularity and function declarations. This program is designed to further encapsulate the logic of the calculator into separate functions, enhancing readability and maintainability.

basicCalculator2.h
This header file contains function declarations for the arithmetic operations, providing a clear interface for the implementation in the source file.

basicCalculator2.cpp
This source file includes the implementation of the functions declared in the header file, along with the main program logic.

In this extended calculator, the arithmetic operations are encapsulated within separate functions defined in the basicCalculator2.h file and implemented in the basicCalculator2.cpp file. This modular approach demonstrates how to organize code effectively, making it easier to read, maintain, and extend.
